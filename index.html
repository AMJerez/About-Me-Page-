         <p>My name is Allison Jerez, and to be honest it really was just a random name my parents gave me. For most of my life I've lived in South LA and as of now 17 years-old. Other than that, I have two older sisters and am the last of the three to be finishing high school.</p>

         <p> In the future I hope to do at least something related to coding. Or at least do one coding competition. Though as of now I'm want to work more with money and how to properly manage it. Which is why I took upon the position as the ASB Treasurer. That is just a little bit about me but there is more below.</p>
